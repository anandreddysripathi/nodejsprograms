MEAN STACK 
->MEAN is a user-friendly full-stack JavaScript framework ideal for building dynamic websites and applications. ->It is a free and open-source stack designed to supply developers with a quick and organized method for   creating rapid prototypes of MEAN-based web applications.
->One of the main benefits of the MEAN stack is that a single language, JavaScript, runs on every level of the   application, making it an efficient and modern approach to web development.
->MEAN applications can be written in one language for both server-side and client-side execution environments.
->The technologies used in mean are 
   i)MangoDB-used to handle databases.Uses JSON objects.MongoDB is a system that is No-SQL. So rather than      having row oriented storage, it has document oriented storage. Document in MongoDB is much like JSON
   ii)Express-uses node.js for backend scripting
   iii)Angular- used for front end development of web page
   iv)Node.js-used for backend development of web page

MERN STACK
->Mern functionality is same as MEAN where in MEAN Angular is used in front-end while in MERN React is used.
->The technologies used in mern are MangoDB,Express,React, and Node.js
