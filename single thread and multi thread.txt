				SINGLE THREAD AND MULTI THREAD:
				--------------------------------
->A thread is a lightweight sub-process, the smallest unit of processing.
Single thread:
--------------
->single thread means execution of only a single thread. We cannot perform many operations at time, only one operation can be performed at one time.
->It blocks the users until the thread execution completes.  

Multithreading:
---------------
->It doesn't block the user because threads are independent and you can perform multiple operations at the same time.
->You can perform many operations together, so it saves time.
->Threads are independent, so it doesn't affect other threads if an exception occurs in a single thread
