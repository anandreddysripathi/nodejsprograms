Idempotency is a property where even if the same methods were called to the server, that dosen't effect the resources at the server.
Methods showing the Idempotency property are called Idempotent Methods.
Let us go through some of the HTTP methods and identify if they exist idempotency or not.

1)GET 
->The method GET is used to retreive values from the server.
->If the client implements multiple HTTP Get requests then resources are not changed or get modified at the server either.
->That means this is safe method.
 
so GET is an IDEMPOTENT HTTP METHOD.

2)PUT
->this method is used to replace a file or resource at the server side from the client's HTTP request to server.
->If multiple requests are made to put a resource then the resource remain same which will be replacable but not changed.
  
EX:
 let us say a client is calling PUT request by giving a file named a.txt to the server.
  If the server has already a.txt then it is replaced by the new file, that means resource remains same.

so PUT is also an IDEMPOTENT HTTP METHOD.

3)DELETE
->This method is used to delete a resource at the server side.
->if a client requests using HTTP DELETE method multiple times, then the given data file or resource is deleted if exists, if it is already deleted then it will have no effect.
 so DELETE is an IDEMPOTENT HTTP METHOD.

4)POST
->this method is used to assign values or insert data or resource at the server side.
->if multiple PUT requests are implemented, then new data is going to be created at the server side.
->so repeatable calls are not safe here.
->need to make as many calls as we need, if making multiple calls then we endup changing something on the server.
 POST does not exhibit IDEMPOTENCY.

IDEMPOTENT methods are safely-repeatable.
