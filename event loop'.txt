						Event Loop:
						-----------
->The Event Loop is a queue of callback functions. When an async function executes, the callback function is   pushed into the queue. The JavaScript engine doesn't start processing the event loop until the code after an   async function has executed.
->In an event-driven application, there is generally a main loop that listens for events,and then triggers a     callback function when one of those events is detected.
->Node.js is a single-threaded application, still it can supports concurrency via the concept of event and       callbacks.
->Node thread keeps an event loop and whenever a task gets completed,it fires the corresponding event which     signals the event-listener function to execute.
