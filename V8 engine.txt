						V8engine:
						---------
->V8 is a JavaScript engine built at the google development center, in Germany. 
->It is open source and written in C++. It is used for both client side (Google Chrome) and server side           (node.js) JavaScript applications.
->V8 provides the runtime environment in which JavaScript executes. The DOM, and the other Web Platform APIs   are provided by the browser.
->It is portable and runs on Mac, Windows, Linux and   several other systems.
->V8 was first designed to increase the performance of the JavaScript execution inside web browsers. In order     to obtain speed, V8 translates JavaScript code into more efficient machine code instead of using an         interpreter.
->It compiles JavaScript code into machine code at execution by implementing a JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler        like a lot of modern JavaScript engines such as SpiderMonkey or Rhino (Mozilla) ,
  Safari has JavaScriptCore (also called Nitro),Edge has Chakra. The main difference with V8 is that it        doesn’t produce bytecode or any intermediate code.
