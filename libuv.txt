						LIBUV:
						------
->libuv (Unicorn Velociraptor Library) is a multi-platform C library that provides support for asynchronous I/O   based on event loops.
->In simple words, libuv is a library that allows your JavaScript code (via V8) to perform I/O, whether it is   network, file etc. So from TCP level connectivity all the way to file/system ops are actually performed by   the libuv library.
->LibUv performs, maintains and manages all the io and events in the event pool.
